Create multiple time entries
------------------------------------

This plugin adds a link at the bottom of the log time form (only when creating, not when editing) to log time massively. The link display the same form but with a multiple choice select field to select users. The logged time will be created for those users selected. This is accessible only if the user has the 'create_multiple_time_entries' permission.
